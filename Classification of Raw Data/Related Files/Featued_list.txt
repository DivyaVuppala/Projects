Abyssinia Henry is the 72nd episode of the MASH television series and the final episode of the series third season First aired on March 18 1975 and written by Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell the highly rated episode was most notable for its shocking and unexpected ending The plot of the episode centers on the honorable discharge and subsequent departure of the 4077th MASHs commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake played by McLean Stevenson
The title of the episode refers to the slang use of Abyssinia for goodbye Abyssinia pronounced abeeSINeeah can be understood as Ill be seeing you In the 1920s and 1930s Abyssinia was the name for the country now called Ethiopia It is mistakenly said that this slang was frequently used by the Henry Blake character throughout his years on the show In fact whenever Blake would bid farewell it was usually by saying goombye though Blake did use this term at least once
The highly controversial ending to the episode which has since been referenced and parodied many times prompted more than 1000 letters to series producers Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart and drew fire from both CBS and 20th Century Fox
After the production of this episode both Stevenson and Wayne Rogers who played the character of Trapper John McIntyre left the series to pursue other interests While Stevensons departure was announced prior to and written into Abyssinia Henry Rogers unexpectedly left the series during the break between Seasons Three and Four and so his characters departure takes place offscreen in the following episode Welcome to Korea the first of the shows fourth season These combined departures and their subsequent replacements also signaled the beginning of a major shift in focus of the MASH series as a whole with story and script focus emphasizing the character of Hawkeye Pierce played by Alan Alda

Brisco was developed by Boam and Cuse at the request of Fox executive Bob Greenblatt Impressed by the duos work on the script for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Greenblatt suggested they develop a series that bore the tone and style of vintage movie serials The initial ideas and proposals from the shows writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down Brisco was one of the last television shows to be filmed on the Warner Bros Western backlot Randy Edelman composed the distinctive theme music which has been reused by the National Broadcasting Company during its coverage of the Olympic Games
During its broadcast run The Adventures of Brisco County Jr garnered a small but dedicated following and was well received by critics The series earned high ratings at the beginning of its season but later episodes failed to attract a substantial number of viewers Fox canceled the show at the end of its first and only season In 2006 Warner Home Video released a DVD set containing all 27 episodes The series has been remembered fondly by critics who praise its humor and unique blend of genres

Ceteris paribus or caeteris paribus is a Latin phrase meaning other things equal English translations of the phrase include all other things being equal or other things held constant or all else unchanged A prediction or a statement about a causal empirical or logical relation between two states of affairs is ceteris paribus if it is acknowledged that the prediction although usually accurate in expected conditions can fail or the relation can be abolished by intervening factors
A ceteris paribus assumption is often key to scientific inquiry as scientists seek to screen out factors that perturb a relation of interest Thus epidemiologists for example may seek to control independent variables as factors that may influence dependent variables—the outcomes or effects of interest Likewise in scientific modeling simplifying assumptions permit illustration or elucidation of concepts thought relevant within the sphere of inquiry
There is ongoing debate in the philosophy of science concerning ceteris paribus statements On the logical empiricist view fundamental physics tends to state universal laws whereas other sciences such as biology psychology and economics tend to state laws that hold true in normal conditions but have exceptions ceteris paribus laws cp laws The focus on universal laws is a criterion distinguishing fundamental physics as fundamental science whereas cp laws are predominant in most other sciences as special sciences whose laws hold in special cases This distinction assumes a logical empiricist view of science It does not readily apply in a mechanistic understanding of scientific discovery There is reasonable disagreement as to whether mechanisms or laws are the appropriate model though mechanisms are the favored method

A B movie is a lowbudget commercial movie that is not an arthouse film In its original usage during the Golden Age of Hollywood the term more precisely identified a film intended for distribution as the lesspublicized bottom half of a double feature Although the US production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s the term B movie continued to be used in the broader sense it maintains today In its post–Golden Age usage there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition on the one hand the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient on the other many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity
In either usage most B movies represent a particular genre—the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple while lowbudget sciencefiction and horror films became more popular in the 1950s Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character Almost always shorter than the topbilled films they were paired with many had running times of 70 minutes or less The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more handsomely budgeted headliners individual B films were often ignored by critics
Latterday B movies still sometimes inspire multiple sequels but series are less common As the average running time of topoftheline films increased so did that of B pictures In its current usage the term has somewhat contradictory connotations it may signal an opinion that a certain movie is a a genre film with minimal artistic ambitions or b a lively energetic film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and unburdened by the conventions of putatively serious independent film The term is also now used loosely to refer to some higherbudgeted mainstream films with exploitationstyle content usually in genres traditionally associated with the B movie
From their beginnings to the present day B movies have provided opportunities both for those coming up in the profession and others whose careers are waning Celebrated filmmakers such as Anthony Mann and Jonathan Demme learned their craft in B movies They are where actors such as John Wayne and Jack Nicholson first became established and they have provided work for former A movie actors such as Vincent Price and Karen Black Some actors such as Bela Lugosi Eddie Constantine and Pam Grier worked in B movies for most of their careers The term B actor is sometimes used to refer to a performer who finds work primarily or exclusively in B pictures 
Barton Fink is a 1991 American period film written produced directed and edited by the Coen brothers Set in 1941 it stars John Turturro in the title role as a young New York City playwright who is hired to write scripts for a film studio in Hollywood and John Goodman as Charlie the insurance salesman who lives next door at the rundown Hotel Earle
The Coens wrote the screenplay in three weeks while experiencing difficulty during the writing of Millers Crossing Soon after Millers Crossing was finished the Coens began filming Barton Fink which had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1991 In a rare sweep Barton Fink won the Palme dOr as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor Turturro Although the film received critical acclaim and was nominated for three Academy Awards it was a box office bomb only grossing 6 million against its 9 million budget The process of writing and the culture of entertainment production are two prominent themes of Barton Fink The world of Hollywood is contrasted with that of Broadway and the film analyzes superficial distinctions between high culture and low culture Other themes in the film include fascism and World War II slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries and the relationship of intellectuals with the common man Because of its diverse elements the film has defied efforts at genre classification being variously referred to as a film noir a horror film a Künstlerroman and a buddy film
The feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the development of the story and careful deliberation went into its design There is a sharp contrast between Finks living quarters and the polished pristine environs of Hollywood especially the home of Jack Lipnick On the wall of Finks room there hangs a single picture of a woman at the beach this captures Bartons attention and the image reappears in the final scene of the film Although the picture and other elements of the film including a mysterious box given to Fink by Charlie appear laden with symbolism critics disagree over their possible meanings The Coens have acknowledged some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any message in the film overall The film contains allusions to many reallife people and events most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner The characters of Barton Fink and W P Mayhew are widely seen as fictional representations of these men but the Coens stress important differences They have also admitted to parodying film magnates like Louis B Mayer but they note that Finks agonizing tribulations in Hollywood are not meant to reflect their own experiences
Barton Fink was influenced by several earlier works including the films of Roman Polanski particularly Repulsion 1965 and The Tenant 1976 Other influences are Stanley Kubricks The Shining and Preston Sturgess Sullivans Travels The film contains a number of literary allusions to works by William Shakespeare John Keats and Flannery OConnor There are also religious overtones including references to the Book of Daniel King Nebuchadnezzar and Bathsheba

The episode was pitched by Wallace Wolodarsky who wanted to parody Cape Fear Originally produced for the fourth season it was held over to the fifth and was therefore the last episode produced by the shows original writers most of whom subsequently left The production crew found it difficult to stretch Cape Feare to the standard duration of half an hour and consequently padded several scenes In one such sequence Sideshow Bob continually steps on rakes the handles of which then hit him in the face this scene became one of the shows most memorable moments The episode is generally considered one of the best of the entire series and the score received an Emmy Award nomination

Set in 2068 Captain Scarlet presents the hostilities between Earth and a race of Martians known as the Mysterons After human astronauts attack their city on Mars the vengeful Mysterons declare war on Earth initiating a series of reprisals that are countered by Spectrum a worldwide security organisation Spectrum boasts the extraordinary abilities of its primary agent Captain Scarlet During the events of the pilot episode Scarlet acquires the Mysteron healing power of retrometabolism and is thereafter considered to be virtually indestructible being able to recover fully from injuries that would normally be fatal
Captain Scarlet the eighth of ten puppet series that the Andersons produced during the 1950s and 1960s was preceded by Thunderbirds and followed by Joe 90 and The Secret Service In terms of visual aesthetic the series represented a departure from Thunderbirds on account of its use of noncaricatured puppets sculpted in realistic proportions Rerun a number of times in the UK and purchased by the BBC in 1993 the 32episode series has entailed tiein merchandise since its first appearance from dolls to original novels and comic strips in the Century 21 Publications childrens magazine TV Century 21
In comparisons to Thunderbirds and other earlier series Captain Scarlet is generally considered darker in tone and less suited to child audiences due to stronger onscreen violence and themes of extraterrestrial aggression and interplanetary war The transition in the puppets design has polarised critical opinion and drawn a mixed response from former production staff although the series has been praised for its inclusion of a multinational multiethnic puppet cast and its depiction of a utopian future Earth Having decided to revive the series in the late 1990s Gerry Anderson supervised the production of a computeranimated reboot Gerry Andersons New Captain Scarlet which was broadcast in the UK in 2005

Cartman Gets an Anal Probe is the first episode of the American animated television series South Park It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on August 13 1997 The episode introduces child protagonists Eric Cartman Kyle Broflovski Stan Marsh and Kenny McCormick who attempt to rescue Kyles younger brother Ike from being abducted by aliens
At the time of the writing of the episode South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not yet have a series contract with Comedy Central Short on money the creators animated the episode using paper cutout stop motion technique similar to the short films that were the precursors to the series Cartman Gets an Anal Probe remains the only South Park episode animated largely without the use of computer technology
Part of a reaction to the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States South Park is deliberately offensive Much of the shows humor and of Cartman Gets an Anal Probe arises from the juxtaposition of the seeming innocence of childhood and the violent crude behavior exhibited by the main characters The episode also exemplifies the carnivalesque which includes humor bodily excess linguistic games that challenge official discourse and the inversion of social structures
Initial reviews of the episode were generally negative critics singled out the gratuitous obscenity of the show for particular scorn Regarding the amount of obscenity in the episode Parker later commented that they felt pressure to live up to the earlier shorts which first made the duo popular Critics also compared South Park unfavorably with what they felt were more complex and nuanced animated shows such as Beavis and ButtHead and The Simpsons

Although Casablanca was an Alist film with established stars and firstrate writers no one involved with its production expected it to be anything out of the ordinary It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year Casablanca was rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier It had its world premiere on November 26 1942 in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23 1943 The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run

Death on the Rock was a controversial television documentary produced by Thames Television as part of the current affairs series This Week and broadcast on ITV on 28 April 1988 The programme examined the deaths of three Provisional Irish Republican Army IRA members in Gibraltar on 6 March 1988 at the hands of the British Special Air Service codenamed Operation Flavius Death on the Rock presented evidence that the IRA members were shot without warning or while attempting to surrender It was condemned by the British government while tabloid newspapers denounced it as sensationalist Death on the Rock subsequently became the first individual documentary to be the subject of an independent inquiry in which it was largely vindicated
The project began after it emerged that the three IRA members shot in Gibraltar were found to be unarmed and not in possession of a bomb The series editor Roger Bolton dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in Belfast Satisfied by the journalists findings Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme as the British government refused to comment Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 just under two months after the shootings despite two attempts by Sir Geoffrey Howe the foreign secretary to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority postpone the broadcast Using the eyewitness statements the documentary questioned the governments version of events and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programmes findings none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back with their hands up or shot after falling to the ground The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts
The morning after the broadcast several tabloid newspapers attacked the documentary accusing it of sensationalism and trial by television In the following days they mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta one of the documentarys main witnesses accusing her of being a former prostitute and of being antiBritish Proetta later successfully sued several newspapers for libel Other newspapers accused Death on the Rock of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses statements and criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast The eyewitnesses interviewed for Death on the Rock gave evidence at the inquest into the shootings most repeated the statements they had given the programme but one witness—who had told the programme he had seen a soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire at the man while he was on the ground—retracted his previous statement As a result of the retraction Thames commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of Death on the Rock—the first time an inquiry had been commissioned into the making of an individual documentary The Windlesham–Rampton report found that the programmes tendency was to present evidence that the IRA members had been unlawfully killed but that it sought to raise questions rather than to reach a conclusion The authors made several criticisms of the documentary but overall found it a trenchant work of journalism made in good faith and without ulterior motives Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished as a result of the Broadcasting Act 1990—decisions which several involved parties believed were influenced by the governments anger at Death on the Rock

Once More with Feeling is the seventh episode of the sixth season of the supernatural drama television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer 1997–2003 and the only one in the series performed as a musical It was written and directed by the shows creator Joss Whedon and originally aired on UPN in the United States on November 6 2001
Once More with Feeling explores changes in the relationships of the main characters using the plot device that a demon—credited as Sweet but unnamed in the episode—compels the people of Sunnydale to break into song at random moments to express hidden truths The title of the episode comes from a line sung by Sweet once the characters have revealed their truths and face the consequences of hearing each others secrets he challenges them to say youre happy now once more with feeling
All of the regular cast performed their own vocals although two actors were given minimal singing at their request Once More with Feeling is the most technically complex episode in the series as extra voice and dance training for the cast was interspersed with the production of four other Buffy episodes It was Joss Whedons first attempt at writing music and different styles—from 1950s sitcom theme music to rock opera—express the characters secrets in specific ways The episode was well received critically upon airing specifically for containing the humor and wit to which fans had become accustomed The musical format allowed characters to stay true to their natures while they struggled to overcome deceit and miscommunication fitting with the sixth seasons themes of growing up and facing adult responsibilities It is considered one of the most effective and popular episodes of the series and—prior to a financial dispute in 2007—was shown in theaters with the audience invited to sing along

Originally the BBC was the sole producer of Persuasion until it partnered with the American company WGBH Boston and the French company Millesime This decision gave the production a larger budget and allowed it to be filmed at locations featured in the novel including Lyme Regis and Bath Michell believed this was Austens most emotional and poignant novel as well as her most autobiographical While directing he avoided what he felt was the polished artificial feel of other 19thcentury depictions and discouraged his actors from wearing makeup or appearing too hygienic Costume designer Alexandra Byrne produced clothing that appeared livedin winning a BAFTA for her efforts

The Quatermass Experiment is a British sciencefiction serial broadcast by BBC Television during the summer of 1953 and restaged by BBC Four in 2005 Set in the near future against the background of a British space programme it tells the story of the first manned flight into space supervised by Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group When the spaceship that carried the first successful crew returns to Earth two of the three astronauts are missing and the third is behaving strangely It becomes apparent that an alien presence entered the ship during its flight and Quatermass and his associates must prevent the alien from destroying the world
Originally comprising six halfhour episodes it was the first sciencefiction production to be written especially for an adult television audience in Britain Previous writtenfortelevision efforts such as Stranger from Space 1951–52 were aimed at children whereas adult entries into the genre were adapted from literary sources such as RUR 1938 and again in 1948 and The Time Machine 1949 The serial was the first of four Quatermass productions to be screened on British television between 1953 and 1979 and was transmitted live from the BBCs original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London one of the final productions before BBC television drama moved to west London
As well as spawning various remakes and sequels The Quatermass Experiment inspired much of the television science fiction that succeeded it particularly in the United Kingdom where it influenced successful series such as Doctor Who and Sapphire and Steel It also influenced successful Hollywood films such as 2001 A Space Odyssey and Alien 
Quatermass II is a British sciencefiction serial originally broadcast by BBC Television in the autumn of 1955 It is the second in the Quatermass series by writer Nigel Kneale and the oldest of those serials to survive in its entirety in the BBC archives
The serial sees Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group being asked to examine strange meteorite showers His investigations lead to his uncovering a conspiracy involving alien infiltration at the highest levels of the British Government As even some of Quatermasss closest colleagues fall victim to the alien influence he is forced to use his own unsafe rocket prototype which recently caused a nuclear disaster at an Australian testing range to prevent the aliens from taking over mankind
Although sometimes compared unfavourably to the first and third Quatermass serials Quatermass II was praised for its allegorical concerns of the damaging effects of industrialisation and the corruption of governments by big business It is described on the British Film Institutes Screenonline website as compulsive viewing 
Quatermass and the Pit is a British television sciencefiction serial transmitted live by BBC Television in December 1958 and January 1959 It was the third and last of the BBCs Quatermass serials although the chief character Professor Bernard Quatermass reappeared in a 1979 ITV production called Quatermass Like its predecessors Quatermass and the Pit was written by Nigel Kneale
The serial continues the loose chronology of the Quatermass adventures Workmen excavating a site in Knightsbridge London discover a strange skull and what at first appears to be an unexploded bomb Quatermass and his newly appointed military superior at the British Experimental Rocket Group Colonel Breen become involved in the investigation when it becomes apparent that the object is an alien spacecraft The ship and its contents have a powerful and malign influence over many of those who come in contact with it including Quatermass It becomes obvious to him that the aliens probably from Mars had been abducting prehumans and modifying them to give them psychic abilities much like their own before returning them to Earth a genetic legacy responsible for much of the war and strife in the world
The serial has been cited as having influenced Stephen King and the film director John Carpenter It featured in the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute in 2000 which described it as completely gripping 
A Quiet Night In is the second episode of the British dark comedy television anthology series Inside No 9 It first aired on 12 February 2014 on BBC Two Written by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton it stars the writers as a pair of hapless burglars attempting to break into the large modernist house of a couple—played by Denis Lawson and Oona Chaplin—to steal a painting Once the burglars make it into the house they encounter obstacle after obstacle while the lovers unaware of the burglars presence argue The episode progresses almost entirely without dialogue relying instead on physical comedy and slapstick though more sinister elements are present in the plot In addition to Pemberton Shearsmith Lawson and Chaplin A Quiet Night In stars Joyce Veheary and Kayvan Novak
Shearsmith and Pemberton had originally considered including a dialoguefree segment in their television series Psychoville but ultimately did not they found the format of Inside No 9 appropriate for revisiting the idea Both journalists and those involved with the episodes production commented on the casting of Chaplin a grandchild of the silent film star Charlie Chaplin in an almost entirely dialoguefree episode though her casting was not a deliberate homage Critics generally responded positively to the episode and a particularly laudatory review by David Chater was published in The Times prompting a complaint from a reader who found the episode more traumatic than comedic On its first airing A Quiet Night In was watched by 940000 viewers 48% of the market
A Quiet Night In was submitted to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for the 2015 awards but it was not nominated Pemberton and Shearsmith have said that they have no plans to do further silent episodes but have compared A Quiet Night In to the highlyexperimental Cold Comfort from Inside No 9s second series a sentiment echoed by some television critics

The show has undergone significant changes throughout its history The format of Sesame Street consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audiences viewing habits With the creation of Sesame Street producers and writers of a childrens television show used for the first time educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content It was also the first time a shows educational effects were studied
Shortly after creating Sesame Street its producers developed what came to be called the CTW model after the production companys previous name a system of television show planning production and evaluation based on collaborations between producers writers educators and researchers The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat selfsupporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements international sales and other media By 2006 there were independently produced versions or coproductions of Sesame Street broadcast in twenty countries In 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of Sesame Street and by the shows 40th anniversary in 2009 it was broadcast in more than 140 countries
By its 40th anniversary in 2009 Sesame Street was the fifteenthhighestrated childrens television show in the United States A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old In 2008 it was estimated that 77 million Americans had watched the series as children As of 2014 Sesame Street has won 167 Emmy Awards and 8 Grammy Awards—more than any other childrens show 
Sesame Street international coproductions are educational childrens television series based on the American Sesame Street but tailored to the countries in which they are produced Shortly after the debut of Sesame Street in the US in 1969 television producers teachers and officials of several countries approached the shows producers and the executives of Childrens Television Workshop CTW about the possibility of airing international versions of Sesame Street Creator Joan Ganz Cooney hired former CBS executive Mike Dann to field offers to produce versions of the show in other countries
The producers of these shows developed them using a variant on the CTW model a flexible model of production based upon the experiences of the creators and producers of the US show The model consisted of the combination of producers and researchers working together on the show the development of a unique curriculum and extensive test screening of the shows The shows came to be called coproductions and they contained original sets characters and curriculum goals Different coproductions were produced depending upon each countrys needs and resources They included both dubbed versions of the American show and versions created developed and produced in each country that reflected their needs educational priorities and culture For example the first HIVpositive Muppet Kami from the South African coproduction Takalani Sesame was created in 2003 to address the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa and was met with controversy in the US By 2006 there were 20 coproductions in countries all over the world In 2001 there were more than 120 million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street and by the US shows 40th anniversary in 2009 they were seen in more than 140 countries 
In 1969 the childrens television show Sesame Street premiered on the Public Broadcasting Service PBS in the United States Unlike earlier childrens programming the shows producers used research and over 1000 studies and experiments to create the show and test its impact on its young viewers learning By the end of the programs first season the organization founded to oversee Sesame Street production Childrens Television Workshop CTW had developed what came to be called the CTW model a system of planning production and evaluation that combined the expertise of researchers and early childhood educators with that of the programs writers producers and directors
CTW conducted research in two ways inhouse formative research that informed and improved production and independent summative evaluations conducted by the Educational Testing Service ETS during the shows first two seasons to measure the programs educational effectiveness CTW researchers invented tools to measure young viewers attention to the program Based on these findings the researchers compiled a body of data and the producers changed the show accordingly The formative research on Sesame Street was the first time childrens television viewing was studied scientifically
Summative research conducted over the years including two landmark evaluations in 1970 and 1971 demonstrated that viewing the program had positive effects on young viewers learning school readiness and social skills Subsequent studies have replicated these findings such as the effect of the show in countries outside of the US several longitudinal studies the effects of war and natural disasters on young children and studies about how the show affected viewers cognition As CTW researcher Gerald S Lesser stated in 1974 early tests conducted on the show both formative and summative suggested that Sesame Street was making strides towards teaching what it had set out to teach 
Sesame Workshop SW or the Workshop formerly known as the Childrens Television Workshop CTW is an American nonprofit organization behind the production of several educational childrens programs—including its first and bestknown Sesame Street—that have run on public broadcasting around the world Television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and foundation executive Lloyd Morrisett came up with the idea to form an organization to oversee the production of Sesame Street a television show which would help children especially those from lowincome families prepare for school They spent two years from 1966 to 1968 researching developing and raising money for the new show Cooney was named as the Workshops first executive director which was called one of the most important television developments of the decade
Sesame Street premiered on PBS in the United States in November 1969 and the Workshop was formally incorporated shortly after in 1970 Gerald S Lesser and Edward L Palmer were hired to conduct research for the show they were responsible for developing a system of planning production and evaluation and the interaction between television producers and educators later called the CTW model They also hired a staff of producers and writers After the initial success of Sesame Street they began to plan for its continued survival which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other TV shows The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop difficulty in finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments hurt the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985
After Sesame Streets initial success the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show since their funding sources were made up of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects not sustain them Government funding ended by 1981 so the CTW expanded into other areas including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs the publications of books and music international coproductions interactive media and new technologies licensing arrangements and outreach programs to preschools By 2005 income from the CTWs international coproductions of the show was 96 million By 2008 the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for 15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees Cooney stepped down as CEO in 1990 David Britt was named as her replacement In June 5 2000 the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop to better reflect its work beyond television and into interactive media and Gary Knell became CEO H Melvin Ming replaced Knell in 2011 In 2014 Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D Dunn

The Sinking of the Lusitania 1918 is a silent animated short film by American cartoonist Winsor McCay It is a work of propaganda recreating the neverphotographed 1915 sinking of the British liner RMS Lusitania At twelve minutes it has been called the longest work of animation at the time of its release The film is the earliest surviving animated documentary and serious dramatic work of animation
In 1915 a German submarine torpedoed and sank the RMS Lusitania 128 Americans were among the 1198 dead The event outraged McCay but the newspapers of his employer William Randolph Hearst downplayed the event as Hearst was opposed to the US joining World War I McCay was required to illustrate antiwar and antiBritish editorial cartoons for Hearsts papers In 1916 McCay rebelled against his employers stance and began work on the patriotic Sinking of the Lusitania on his own time with his own money
The film followed McCays earlier successes in animation Little Nemo 1911 How a Mosquito Operates 1912 and Gertie the Dinosaur 1914 McCay drew these earlier films on rice paper onto which backgrounds had to be laboriously traced The Sinking of the Lusitania was the first film McCay made using the new more efficient cel technology McCay and his assistants spent twentytwo months making the film His subsequent animation output suffered setbacks as the film was not as commercially successful as his earlier efforts and Hearst put increased pressure on McCay to devote his time to editorial drawings

A sound film is a motion picture with synchronized sound or sound technologically coupled to image as opposed to a silent film The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900 but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early soundondisc systems and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate Innovations in soundonfilm led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology which took place in 1923
The primary steps in the commercialization of sound cinema were taken in the mid to late 1920s At first the sound films which included synchronized dialogue known as talking pictures or talkies were exclusively shorts The earliest featurelength movies with recorded sound included only music and effects The first feature film originally presented as a talkie was The Jazz Singer released in October 1927 A major hit it was made with Vitaphone which was at the time the leading brand of soundondisc technology Soundonfilm however would soon become the standard for talking pictures
By the early 1930s the talkies were a global phenomenon In the United States they helped secure Hollywoods position as one of the worlds most powerful culturalcommercial centers of influence see Cinema of the United States In Europe and to a lesser degree elsewhere the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema In Japan where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance talking pictures were slow to take root In India sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nations film industry

Wilber conceived the general plot for a different series Captain Video and His Video Rangers which featured humans from Ancient Greece who were preserved in cryogenic suspension and revived The script changed numerous times during preproduction as producer Bob Justman felt that it would be too expensive to film Eventually Gene L Coon and series creator Gene Roddenberry also made alterations These revisions include the marooning of the criminals at the end of the episode and the change of the primary villain from a Nordic character to a Sikh Roddenberry attempted to claim the primary writing credit for Space Seed a request turned down by the Writers Guild of America
Montalbán was the casting directors first choice for Khan and described the role as wonderful Despite being planned as an inexpensive bottle episode the special sets and shots using starship miniatures caused the episode to go over budget On first broadcast the episode held second place in the ratings for the first halfhour with 1312 million viewers but during the second half it was pushed into third place Space Seed has been named one of the best episodes of the series by Cinefantastique IGN and other publications The 1982 film Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan serves as a sequel to this episode Plot elements of the episode and The Wrath of Khan were also used in the 2013 film Star Trek Into Darkness and references to it appear in episodes of Star Trek Enterprise

Production of Squeeze was problematic creative differences between Longstreet and the crew led to him being replaced as director while some missing scenes needed to be shot after the initial filming Because of this turbulence the completion of the episode relied on postproduction techniques However Squeeze has received positive reviews from critics mostly focusing on Hutchisons performance and the resonance of his character The episode has subsequently been described by The Star as the episode that really sold The XFiles idea to the masses Academics have examined Squeeze for its portrayal of the politics of law enforcement highlighting the tension—evident throughout the series—between the agents desire to find the truth and their duty to secure criminal convictions

Street newspapers or street papers are newspapers or magazines sold by homeless or poor individuals and produced mainly to support these populations Most such newspapers primarily provide coverage about homelessness and povertyrelated issues and seek to strengthen social networks within homeless communities Street papers aim to give these individuals both employment opportunities and a voice in their community In addition to being sold by homeless individuals many of these papers are partially produced and written by them
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries several publications by charity religious and labor organizations tried to draw attention to the homeless but street newspapers only became common after the founding of New York Citys Street News in 1989 Similar papers are now published in over 30 countries with most located in the United States and Western Europe They are supported by governments charities and coalitions such as the International Network of Street Papers and the North American Street Newspaper Association Although street newspapers have multiplied many still face challenges including funding shortages unreliable staff and difficulty in generating interest and maintaining an audience
Street newspapers are sold mainly by homeless individuals but the newspapers vary in how much content is submitted by them and how much of the coverage pertains to them while some papers are written and published mainly by homeless contributors others have a professional staff and attempt to emulate mainstream publications These differences have caused controversy among street newspaper publishers over what type of material should be covered and to what extent the homeless should participate in writing and production One popular street newspaper The Big Issue has been a focus of this controversy because it concentrates on attracting a large readership through coverage of mainstream issues and popular culture whereas other newspapers emphasize homeless advocacy and social issues and earn less of a profit

Tenebrae also known as Tenebre is a 1982 Italian giallo film written and directed by Dario Argento The film stars Anthony Franciosa as American author Peter Neal who – while in Rome promoting his latest murdermystery novel – becomes embroiled in the search for a serial killer who may have been inspired to kill by the novel John Saxon and Daria Nicolodi costar as Neals agent and assistant Giuliano Gemma and Carola Stagnaro appear as detectives investigating the murders John Steiner Veronica Lario and Mirella DAngelo also feature The film has been described as exploring themes of dualism and sexual aberration and has strong metafictional elements some commentators consider Tenebrae to be a direct reaction by Argento to criticism of his previous work most especially his depictions of murders of beautiful women
After Argento had experimented with pure supernatural horror with 1977s Suspiria and 1980s Inferno Tenebrae represented the filmmakers return to the giallo horror subgenre which he had helped popularize in the 1970s Argento was inspired by a series of incidents which saw an obsessed fan telephone the director to criticise him for the damaging psychological effects of his previous work The telephone calls culminated in death threats towards Argento who channelled the experience into the writing of Tenebrae The director also wanted to explore the senselessness of killings he had witnessed and heard about while staying in Los Angeles in 1980 and his feeling at the time that true horror came from those who wanted to kill for nothing
Shot on location in Rome and at Elios Studios Tenebrae utilised mostly modernlooking locations and sets to help Argento realise his intent that the film reflect a nearfuture with a diminished population the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome Employing director of photography Luciano Tovoli Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark realistic lighting featured in television police shows at the time production designer Giuseppe Bassa created supporting environments that were cold and austere with sharp angles and modernistic spaces Several former members of Italian rock band Goblin provided Tenebraes music a synthheavy score inspired by rock and disco music
Tenebrae was a modest success in Italy it reached theatres with little controversy after Argento made cuts to one of the most violent scenes However in the United Kingdom it was added to the infamous list of video nasties and banned from sale until 1999 The films theatrical distribution in the United States was delayed until 1984 when it was released in a heavily censored version under the title Unsane In its cut form Tenebrae received a mostly negative critical reception but the original fully restored version later became widely available for reappraisal it is considered by some to be one of Argentos best thrillers The film critic and author Maitland McDonagh said that it was in many respects  the finest film that Argento has ever made

Thomas Todd Manning is a fictional character from the American daytime drama One Life to Live OLTL Created by writer Michael Malone the role was originated in 1992 by actor Roger Howarth Todd was a college student and fraternity brother to Kevin Buchanan Zach Rosen and Powell Lord and became part of a storyline in which Marty Saybrooke is gang raped The storyline was considered groundbreaking by television critics Its main players—Howarth Susan Haskell Marty and Hillary B Smith Todds lawyer Nora Hanen—won Emmys in 1994 as did Malone and his writing team Howarth left the role in 2003 it was recast with Trevor St John physically altered by plastic surgery In 2011 Howarth returned to OLTL it was disclosed Todd had been taken hostage and St Johns version of the character was really Todds identical twin brother Victor Lord Jr conditioned to assume Todds place
Todd was initially a shortterm villain but his popularity with the audience and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past While keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion They took steps to redeem him and made him an integral part of OLTLs canvas despite Howarths objections to a redemption storyline With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc the writers borrowed from nineteenthcentury melodrama and Gothic traditions and literature such as Frankenstein Todd became the product of an affair between his father Victor Lord and his mother Irene Manning which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters including his sisters Tina and Victoria Lord An important aspect of the character became his appearance most notably the scar on his right cheek which emerged as synonymous with him and served to remind him of his past misdeeds against Marty Music and the use of humor were also key to Todds development Although he formed many relationships including with his wives Blair Cramer and Téa Delgado and fathered children a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy
The drive to redeem Todd eventually drew Howarth who always saw Todd as a villain to leave the show for a year he was uncomfortable with the redemption storyline and with many fans positive reactions to Todd Recasting Todd years later with St John was generally considered successful by viewers and critics St John instead of imitating Howarths portrayal brought his own spin to the character After OLTLs cancellation in 2012 Howarth brought Todd to General Hospital GH but returned along with St John as Victor Jr to the online version of OLTL in 2013 which was cancelled after one year
Todd has been the subject of numerous soap opera articles feminist studies and inspired the creation of a doll in his likeness He has remained a popular and controversial figure since his creation and is considered one of soap operas breakout characters

Director Reeves featured many scenes of intense onscreen torture and violence that were considered unusually sadistic at the time Upon its theatrical release throughout the spring and summer of 1968 the movies gruesome content was met with disgust by several film critics in the UK despite having been extensively censored by the British Board of Film Censors In the US the film was shown virtually intact and was a box office success but it was almost completely ignored by reviewers
Witchfinder General eventually developed into a cult film partially attributable to Reevess 1969 death from a drug overdose at the age of 25 only nine months after Witchfinders release Over the years several prominent critics have championed the film including J Hoberman Danny Peary and Derek Malcolm In 2005 the magazine Total Film named Witchfinder General the 15thgreatest horror film of all time
