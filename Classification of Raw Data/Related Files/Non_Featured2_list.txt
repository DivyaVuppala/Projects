According to the St James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture Jolson was to jazz blues and ragtime what Elvis Presley was to rock n roll Being the first popular singer to make a spectacular event out of singing a song he became a rock star before the dawn of rock music His specialty was performing on stage runways extending out into the audience He would run up and down the runway and across the stage teasing cajoling and thrilling the audience often stopping to sing to individual members all the while the perspiration would be pouring from his face and the entire audience would get caught up in the ecstasy of his performance According to music historian Larry Stempel No one had heard anything quite like it before on Broadway Author Stephen Banfield agreed writing that Jolsons style was arguably the single most important factor in defining the modern musical
Jolson also enjoyed performing in blackface makeup a theatrical convention since the mid19th century With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music such as jazz and blues he was later credited with singlehandedly introducing AfricanAmerican music to white audiences As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against black discrimination on Broadway
